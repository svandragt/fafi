Fafi
====

Search Firefox bookmark contents, with this commandline client. Fafi extracts the content of the bookmarks and stores them into a searchable SQLite database.

Things it does:


* Detects your places database from the Firefox profile folder. (support for picking a profile from multiple profiles)
* Extract main text content from all bookmarks into ``<user_data_dir>/fafi/data.sqlite``.
* Skips .local and .test domains.
* Skips pages that are already indexed.
* Search results are ranked by relevance and displayed with snippets.

URLs are stored together with the main page context as determined by `Newspaper <https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper>`_.
